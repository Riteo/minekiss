WARNING: This project has been archived as I stopped playing Minecraft. It has
been a fun, albeit very broken, little project. Obviously you can still fork it
and do whatever you want with the project, being in the public domain.

minekiss is a shitty Minecraft launcher written in POSIX shell.

Yes, you heard that right. This should in theory only need a POSIX compliant
shell, some of it utilities (awk, sed, head etc.), curl, jq and Java of course.

Right now it's still hardcoded to download Linux native libraries, doesn't
support Microsoft accounts yet and there's still quite a lot of stuff to do.
Look for "TODO" comments in the script.

It's usable though, and I unironically use it to run Minecraft.

It works with normal FabricMC version definitions. Just specify the data dir as
a destination for its installer, disabling profile creation if you don't want
junk files since they'll be unused.

I guess this will make more sense when KISS Linux will have decent Java support.

This software is under the Unlicense, which means that you can do anything you
want with it, no strings attached or attribution required.
